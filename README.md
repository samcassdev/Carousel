# Carousel Project

This web application allows users to view each photo in the slideshow at once by clicking next and then back to start all over. In this web application, I decided to use the concept of a simple vegan menu with an assortment of different, creative dishes.

## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Optimizations

I would add a feature to allow the user to continuously move through the menu without the need to click back in order to start all over from the beginning.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned how to incorporate the use of arrays with a variety of images.
